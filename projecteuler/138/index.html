<p>Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, <i>b</i> = 16, and legs, L = 17.</p>
<div style='text-align:center;'>

</div>
<p>By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the triangle, <i>h</i> = (17<sup>2</sup>  8<sup>2</sup>) = 15, which is one less than the base length.</p>
<p>With <i>b</i> = 272 and L = 305, we get <i>h</i> = 273, which is one more than the base length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with the property that <i>h</i> = <i>b</i>  1.</p>
<p>Find  L for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which <i>h</i> = <i>b</i>  1 and <i>b</i>, L are positive integers.</p>
