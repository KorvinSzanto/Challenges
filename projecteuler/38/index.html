<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:</p>
<blockquote>192  1 = 192<br />
192  2 = 384<br />
192  3 = 576</blockquote>
<p>By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)</p>
<p>The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).</p>
<p>What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , <var>n</var>) where <var>n</var>  1?</p>
