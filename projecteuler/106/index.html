<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size <i>n</i>. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the following properties are true:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li>S(B)  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.</li>
<li>If B contains more elements than C then S(B)  S(C).</li>
</ol>
<p>For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains <i>n</i> strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which <i>n</i> = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule). Similarly, when <i>n</i> = 7, only 70 out of the 966 subset pairs need to be tested.</p>
<p>For <i>n</i> = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality?</p>
