<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>We shall say that an <var>n</var>-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to <var>n</var> exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.</p>

<p>The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39  186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.</p>

<p>Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.</p>

<div class="info">HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.</div>
