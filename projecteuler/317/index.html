<p>
A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.
</p>
<p>
We assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with g=9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Find the volume (in m<sup>3</sup>) of the region through which the fragments move before reaching the ground. 
Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.
