<p>
An even positive integer N will be called admissible, if it is a power of 2 or its distinct prime factors are consecutive primes.<br />
The first twelve admissible numbers are 2,4,6,8,12,16,18,24,30,32,36,48.
</p>
<p>
If N is admissible, the smallest integer M  1 such that N+M is prime, will be called the pseudo-Fortunate number for N.
</p>
<p>
For example, N=630 is admissible since it is even and its distinct prime factors are the consecutive primes 2,3,5 and 7.<br /> 
The next prime number after 631 is 641; hence, the pseudo-Fortunate number for 630 is M=11.<br />
It can also be seen that the pseudo-Fortunate number for 16 is 3.
</p>
<p>
Find the sum of all distinct pseudo-Fortunate numbers for admissible numbers N less than 10<sup>9</sup>.
