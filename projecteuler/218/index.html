<p>Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25.
The area of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.<br />
Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd(b,c)=1.<br />
Also c is a perfect square.</p>

<p>We will call a right angled triangle perfect if<br />
-it is a primitive right angled triangle<br />
-its hypotenuse is a perfect square</p>

<p>We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if<br />
-it is a perfect right angled triangle and<br />
-its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28.
</p>

<p>How many perfect right-angled triangles with c10<sup>16</sup> exist that are not super-perfect?</p>
