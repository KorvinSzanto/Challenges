<div class="problem_content" role="problem">

<p>A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p style='margin-left:50px;'>44  32  13  10  <b>1</b>  <b>1</b><br />
85  <b>89</b>  145  42  20  4  16  37  58  <b>89</b></p>
<p>Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.</p>
<p>How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?</p>
