<P>
The number 7 is special, because 7 is 111 written in base 2, and 11 written in base 6 <BR/>(i.e. 7<sub>10</sub> = 11<sub>6</sub> = 111<sub>2</sub>). In other words, 7 is a repunit in at least two bases b > 1. 
</P>
<P>
We shall call a positive integer with this property a strong repunit. It can be verified that there are 8 strong repunits below 50:  {1,7,13,15,21,31,40,43}. <BR/>Furthermore, the sum of all strong repunits below 1000 equals 15864.
</P>
Find the sum of all strong repunits below 10<sup>12</sup>.
