<P>
The largest integer  100 that is only divisible by both the primes 2 and 3 is 96, as 96=32*3=2<sup>5</sup>*3.
For two <i>distinct</i> primes p and q let M(p,q,N) be the largest positive integer N only divisible
by both p and q and M(p,q,N)=0 if such a positive integer does not exist.
</P>
<P>
E.g. M(2,3,100)=96.<BR/> 
M(3,5,100)=75 and not 90 because 90 is divisible by 2 ,3 and 5.<BR/>
Also M(2,73,100)=0 because there does not exist a positive integer  100 that is divisible by both 2 and 73.
</P>
<P>
Let S(N) be the sum of all distinct M(p,q,N).
S(100)=2262.
</P>
<P>
Find S(10 000 000).
