Let's call S the (infinite) string that is made by concatenating the consecutive positive integers (starting from 1)  written down in base 10.<BR /> 
Thus, S = 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242...

<P>
It's easy to see that any number will show up an infinite number of times in S.
</P>
<P>
Let's call f(n) the starting position of the n<sup>th</sup> occurrence of n in S.<BR /> 
For example, f(1)=1, f(5)=81, f(12)=271 and f(7780)=111111365.
