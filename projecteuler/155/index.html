<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same value C.
<br />
The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form sub-units, which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a final circuit.</p>
<p>Using this simple procedure and up to <var>n</var> identical capacitors, we can make circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For example, using up to <var>n</var>=3 capacitors of 60 F each, we can obtain the following 7 distinct total capacitance values: </p>
<div style='text-align:center;'></div>
<p>If we denote by <var>D</var>(<var>n</var>) the number of distinct total capacitance values we can obtain when using up to <var>n</var> equal-valued capacitors and the simple procedure described above, we have: <var>D</var>(1)=1, <var>D</var>(2)=3, <var>D</var>(3)=7 ...</p>
<p>Find <var>D</var>(18).</p>
<p><i>Reminder :</i> When connecting capacitors C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub> etc in parallel, the total capacitance is C<sub>T</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;C<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;C<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+...,
<br />
whereas when connecting them in series, the overall capacitance is given by:
