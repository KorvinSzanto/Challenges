<p>A <b>spherical triangle</b> is a figure formed on the surface of a sphere by three <b>great circular arcs</b> intersecting pairwise in three vertices.</p>

<div align='center'></div>


<p>Let C(<var>r</var>) be the sphere with the centre (0,0,0) and radius <var>r</var>.<br />
Let Z(<var>r</var>) be the set of points on the surface of C(<var>r</var>) with integer coordinates.<br />
Let T(<var>r</var>) be the set of spherical triangles with vertices in Z(<var>r</var>).
Degenerate spherical triangles, formed by three points on the same great arc, are <u>not</u> included in T(<var>r</var>).<br />
Let A(<var>r</var>) be the area of the smallest spherical triangle in T(<var>r</var>).</p>

<p>For example A(14) is 3.294040 rounded to six decimal places.</p>

<p>Find  A(<var>r</var>). Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.</p>
