Consider the real number 2+3.<BR />
When we calculate the even powers of 2+3
we get:<BR />
(2+3)<sup>2</sup> = 9.898979485566356...<BR />
(2+3)<sup>4</sup> = 97.98979485566356...<BR />
(2+3)<sup>6</sup> = 969.998969071069263...<BR />
(2+3)<sup>8</sup> = 9601.99989585502907...<BR />
(2+3)<sup>10</sup> = 95049.999989479221...<BR />
(2+3)<sup>12</sup> = 940897.9999989371855...<BR />
(2+3)<sup>14</sup> = 9313929.99999989263...<BR />
(2+3)<sup>16</sup> = 92198401.99999998915...<BR />
</p>
<p>
It looks like that the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of the fractional part of these powers is non-decreasing.<BR />
In fact it can be proven that the fractional part of (2+3)<sup>2n</sup> approaches 1 for large n.
</p>
<p>
Consider all real numbers of the form p+q with p and q positive integers and pq, such that the fractional part 
of (p+q)<sup>2n</sup> approaches 1 for large n.
</p>
<p>
Let C(p,q,n) be the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of the fractional part of <BR /> (p+q)<sup>2n</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Let N(p,q) be the minimal value of n such that C(p,q,n)  2011.
</p>
<p>
Find N(p,q) for p+q  2011.
