<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>The following game is a classic example of Combinatorial Game Theory:</p>

<p>Two players start with a strip of <var>n</var> white squares and they take alternate turns.<br />
On each turn, a player picks two contiguous white squares and paints them black.<br />
The first player who cannot make a move loses.</p>

<p><ul>
<li>If <var>n</var> = 1, there are no valid moves, so the first player loses automatically.</li>
<li>If <var>n</var> = 2, there is only one valid move, after which the second player loses.</li>
<li>If <var>n</var> = 3, there are two valid moves, but both leave a situation where the second player loses.</li>
<li>If <var>n</var> = 4, there are three valid moves for the first player; she can win the game by painting the two middle squares.</li>
<li>If <var>n</var> = 5, there are four valid moves for the first player (shown below in red); but no matter what she does, the second player (blue) wins.</li>
</ul>
<div align='center'></div>
</p>

<p>So, for 1  <var>n</var>  5, there are 3 values of <var>n</var> for which the first player can force a win.<br />
Similarly, for 1  <var>n</var>  50, there are 40 values of <var>n</var> for which the first player can force a win.</p>

<p>For 1  <var>n</var>  1 000 000, how many values of <var>n</var> are there for which the first player can force a win?</p>
</div><br />
